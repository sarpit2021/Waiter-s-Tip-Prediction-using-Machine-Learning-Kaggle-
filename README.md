# Waiter-s-Tip-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Kaggle-

If you have recently visited a restaurant for a family dinner or lunch and you have tipped the waiter for his generous behavior then this project might excite you. As in this article, we will try to predict what amount of tip a person will give based on his/her visit to the restaurant using some features related to the same.

Let’s start by importing some libraries which will be used for various purposes which will be explained later in this article.

**Importing Libraries and Dataset**

Python libraries make it very easy for us to handle the data and perform typical and complex tasks with a single line of code.

Pandas – This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.

Numpy – Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.

Matplotlib/Seaborn – This library is used to draw visualizations.

Sklearn – This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.

XGBoost – This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.

A**bout Dataset**

One waiter recorded information about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. In all he recorded 244 tips.

Can you predict the tip amount?
